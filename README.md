# motor_anomaly_detection
The content of this repository presents an intelligent fault detection system for electric motors. Vibration and current consumption data was collected from a Nema17 stepper motor, and stored in the all_motor_data.csv file. The vibration data was collected using an accelerometer sensor. After all the data collection is complete, the fault or anomaly detection model is trained using the code in model_training.py file. The information on how the model is deployed and what the results are can be found in keras_model_anomaly.ipynb file.
